This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

A straightforward calculator web application developed using Next.js and React framework. This project showcases the integration of Next.js, a robust React framework for building server-rendered applications, with the flexibility and interactivity of React components.

##Features:
Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Responsive design for seamless usage on various devices
Developed with the latest Next.js and React best practices

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
